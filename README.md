This repository provides a self-contained implementation of the classical optimization algorithms for diagonalizing quantum Hamiltonians. The method are applied to various models in the paper. This method allows for efficient diagonalization circuit constructions for a family of Hamiltonians whose Lie algebras are exponentially large.
